# Seacliff Program ðŸŒŠðŸ“œ

Seacliff is a pioneering Solana program that brings the concept of dominant assurance contracts to the decentralized world of blockchain. Crafted meticulously with the Anchor framework, it offers a unique set of functionalities tailored to establish, manage, and operate assurance contracts. ***More details about this project can be found in this [project proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RX5b0FcILSrzgP73OImFT2dlxnbb_98j5a1_6TvCQ58/edit).***

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- âœ… **Contract Initialization**: Empowers users to initiate contracts with detailed parameters, including the goal, lifespan, and refund bonuses.
- âœ… **Dynamic Error Handling**: Provides precise error messages for various scenarios ensuring a smooth user experience.
- âœ… **Pledging Mechanism**: Allows backers to pledge to contracts seamlessly.
- âœ… **NFT Minting**: pledger NFTs are minted and distributed to backers based on their pledge amounts.
- âœ… **Bonus Redemption**: Facilitates the process of redeeming funds based on contract conditions and outcomes.
- âœ… **NFT Burning**: pledger NFTs are burned upon contract completion or bonus redemption, ensuring a fair and transparent process.

## Setup ðŸ› 

### Install Dependencies

- Go [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install **Rust**.

- Go [here](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) to install **Solana** and then run `solana-keygen new` to create a keypair at the default location. Anchor uses this keypair to run your program tests.

- Go [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to install **Yarn**.

- Go [here](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation) to install **Anchor**.

### Build

```
anchor build
```

Builds programs in the workspace targeting Solana's BPF runtime and emitting IDLs in the target/idl directory.

```
anchor build --verifiable
```

Runs the build inside a docker image so that the output binary is deterministic (assuming a Cargo.lock file is used). This command must be run from within a single crate subdirectory within the workspace. For example, programs/<my-program>/.

### Cluster

```
anchor cluster list
```

This lists **cluster endpoints**:

- Mainnet - <https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com>
- Devnet  - <https://api.devnet.solana.com>
- Testnet - <https://api.testnet.solana.com>

### Deploy

```
anchor deploy
```

Deploys all programs in the workspace to the configured cluster.

### Test

```
anchor test
```

Run an integration test suit against the configured cluster, deploying new versions of all workspace programs before running them. If the configured network is a localnet, then automatically starts the localnetwork and runs the test.

### Instructions

#### `create_contract`
Initializes the contract and transfers the refund bonus from the proposer to the contract.

**Requirements**
- The contract must be uninitialized.
- The proposer must have enough lamports to cover the refund bonus.
- The goal must be greater than or equal to the minimum goal.
- The refund bonus must be greater than or equal to the minimum refund bonus.
- The goal must be greater than the refund bonus.
- The lifespan must be greater than or equal to the minimum lifespan.
- The lifespan must be less than or equal to the maximum lifespan.

**Parameters**
- `proposer` - The proposer of the contract.
- `goal` - The total amount of lamports the contract wishes to raise before the lifespan ends.
- `lifespan` - The lifespan during which the contract must reach its goal.
- `refund_bonus` - The amount of lamports to be paid to the backers if the contract fails to reach its goal before the lifespan ends.
- `system_program` - The system program.
- `pda_account` - The PDA account of the DAC program.
- `nft_mint` - The mint of the NFT that is minted to the backer when they pledge to the contract.

**Errors**
- `ContractAlreadyInitialized` - Cannot initialize an already initialized contract.
- `GoalLessThanMinimum` - Cannot initialize a contract with a goal less than the minimum goal.
- `RefundBonusLessThanMinimum` - Cannot initialize a contract with a refund bonus less than the minimum refund bonus.
- `GoalLessThanRefundBonus` - Cannot initialize a contract with a goal less than the refund bonus.
- `LifespanLessThanMinimum` - Cannot initialize a contract with a lifespan less than the minimum lifespan.
- `LifespanLGreaterThanMaximum` - Cannot initialize a contract with a lifespan greater than the maximum lifespan.
- `NotEnoughLamportsForRefundBonus` - The proposer does not have enough lamports to cover the refund bonus.
- `ArithmeticOverflow` - The operation would cause an overflow.
---

### `pledge`
 Allows backers to pledge to a contract.
    Makes a pledge to the contract and transfers the pledge from the backer to the contract.

**Requirements**
- The contract must be active.
- The contract must not have passed its deadline.
- The amount must be greater than or equal to the minimum pledge.
- The backer must have enough lamports to cover the pledge.

**Parameters**
- `backer` - The backer of the contract.
- `amount` - The amount of lamports to pledge.

- `pda_account` - The PDA account of the DAC program.

**Errors**
- `ContractNotActive` - Cannot pledge to a contract that is not active.
- `DeadlinePassed` - Cannot pledge to a contract that has passed its deadline.
- `PledgeLessThanMinimum` - Cannot pledge less than the minimum pledge.
- `NotEnoughLamportsForPledge` - The backer does not have enough lamports to cover the pledge.
- `ArithmeticOverflow` - The operation would cause an overflow.

---
### `close_contract` 
Closes a contract and burns the pledger NFTs.

  Closes the contract.
      Transfers the refund bonus and all pledged funds to the proposer if the contract reached its goal.
